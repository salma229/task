    <h class="h2">ROYAL NAWAAB IS HOME TO SPECTACULAR BANQUETING SUITES AND THEIR FAMOUS ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT RESTAURANT MENU’S</h><br><br><br>
    <p1>

        With one restaurant situated in one of the most iconic buildings in South Manchester and the other located just on the outskirts of Central London, Royal Nawaab has built a reputation for providing an unrivalled dining experience. Both of our breath-taking lobbies set the tone for an evening of decadent sophistication for the entire family.</p1><br><br>
<p2> With an emphasis on preparing fresh food with the finest ingredients, the team of skilled chefs at both of our Asian restaurants go above and beyond to ensure that the hundreds of diners every night experience the finest halal cuisine. Drawing on influences from India and Pakistan, the authentic cuisine is a huge favourite of the large and inscrutable local Asian community.
</p2><br>
        <p3>
        Over the past 10 years, Royal Nawaab has developed into a well-oiled machine that can cater for more than a thousand people in one night whilst retaining the personal touch that makes the experience all the more enjoyable and relaxing.</p3><br><br>
        <p4>
        More than just a restaurant, Royal Nawaab has the space, amenities, logistics and manpower to handle large corporate events, parties and awe-inspiring weddings. Since opening, the Royal and Ottoman Suites have proved to be two of the UK’s most popular Asian wedding venues, with capacities of 500 and 700 respectively.</p4><br><br>
        
       <p5>The Royal Nawaab London and Manchester teams take great pride in providing exceptional, personal service on your special day. The mood, ambience and atmosphere of the wedding venues are expertly crafted to the individual’s needs and wants. We understand that everyone is unique and has different ideas for their wedding or special event and we will always do our utmost to make these dreams come true.</p5><br><br>
        
      <p6> Royal Nawaab Manchester even appeared on Channel 4’s Big Kitchen series back in 2015 which was also featured on the Travel Channel all over the world, where we were able to showcase our extreme kitchens and detail how our chefs create such mouth-watering dishes and cater to over 1,000 people at a time. This 13 part series featured famous kitchens from New York to Dubai. Royal Nawaab Manchester was honoured to be the only establishment chosen in this country for this prestigious series.</p6><br><br>
        
     <p7>   With elegant surroundings throughout, a warm friendly atmosphere, helpful waiting staff and award-winning cuisine, it is no surprise that we are the UK’s ‘Curry Kings’.</p7><Br><br>
        
       <p8> Our reputation for delicious food has resulted in us becoming the official event caterers for various prestigious country clubs and the Hilton Hotel Group. We are also proud to cater into the Hospitality boxes of MUFC.</p8><br><br>
