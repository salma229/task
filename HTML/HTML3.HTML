<h1>NEIL ROBERTSON</h1>
<p style="color:red ;">


    Top Snooker Pro Neil Robertson is the first Australian to ever win a ranking tournament. He is a formal World Champion winning the World Championship title in 2010. His game just gets better and better. His long-potting, safety play and break building have come a long way in recent years. He is one of the strongest young players in the game today. On 1 April 2010 Robertson made the first official maximum break of his career in his second round match in the 2010 China Open against Peter Ebdon,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHVH-rVAO0E/"target="-blank">proving that he’s right up there amongst the best in the world, and now a member of the ‘147 Club’. Some have noted that his speed of play has slowed since 2010
