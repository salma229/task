<h1>MAKEUP</h1>
<P>
    Facial Makeup Products are products that are used to color and highlight facial features. They can either directly add or alter color or can be applied over a foundation that serves to make the color even and smooth.

<h2>Contour</h2>
<p>
    Contouring is a technique for sculpting and adding dimension to your face by using makeup that is slightly darker or lighter than your actual skin color. Unlike everyday foundation and concealer, which we typically want to match our skin exactly, contouring is all about creating the effect of shadow and light.
</p>
<h3>Concealer</h3>
<p>
    Concealer is similar to foundation except it's generally thicker and hides dark circles, age spots, blemishes and more by hiding pigments and blending these imperfections into the skin. You should always apply concealer on top of your foundation so it doesn't smudge.

<h4>Blusher</h4>
<p>
    Using 'blusher', 'blush' or 'rouge' is a popular way to brighten up the face and emphasise cheekbones.

<h5>Highlighter</h5>
<p>
    Highlighter is a double-whammy product, attracting light and enhancing skin tone, for a lit-from-within look, and can be used to accentuate and "lift" bone structure.
